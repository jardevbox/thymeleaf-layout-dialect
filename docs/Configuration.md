`<head>` element merging
------------------------

When decorating the `<head>` sections of the content and layout templates, the
default behaviour is to place all content elements after the layout ones, eg:

```html
Content.html

<head>
  <title>Hello!</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="content-stylesheet.css"/>
  <script src="content-script.js"></script>
</head>
```

```html
Layout.html

<head>
  <title>Goodbye!</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="layout-stylesheet.css"/>
  <script src="layout-script.js"></script>
</head>
```

Result:

```html
<head>
  <title>Hello!</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="layout-stylesheet.css"/>
  <script src="layout-script.js"></script>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="content-stylesheet.css"/>
  <script src="content-script.js"></script>
</head>
```

However, sometimes we need a smarter merging of elements, such as grouping like
elements together (having scripts with scripts and stylesheets with stylesheets).

```html
Content.html

<head>
  <title>Hello!</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="content-stylesheet.css"/>
  <script src="content-script.js"></script>
</head>
```

```html
Layout.html

<head>
  <title>Goodbye!</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="layout-stylesheet.css"/>
  <script src="layout-script.js"></script>
</head>
```

Result:

```html
<head>
  <title>Hello!</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="layout-stylesheet.css"/>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="content-stylesheet.css"/>
  <script src="layout-script.js"></script>
  <script src="content-script.js"></script>
</head>
```

The Layout dialect can be configured to support either use case, with the
ability for developers to define their own sorting.

This sorting is exposed by the `nz.net.ultraq.thymeleaf.decorators.SortingStrategy`
interface and the layout dialect provides 4 implementations to choose from:

 - `nz.net.ultraq.thymeleaf.decorators.strategies.AppendingStrategy`, the
   default, appends content `<head>` elements after layout ones.  Deprecated.
 - `nz.net.ultraq.thymeleaf.decorators.strategies.GroupingStrategy`, groups like
   elements together.  Deprecated.
 - `nz.net.ultraq.thymeleaf.decorators.strategies.AppendingRespectLayoutTitleStrategy`,
   a new variant of the `AppendingStrategy` which respects the position of the
   `<title>` element based on its position in the layout template.
 - `nz.net.ultraq.thymeleaf.decorators.strategies.GroupingRespectLayoutTitleStrategy`,
   a new variant of the `GroupingStrategy` which respects the position of the
   `<title>` element based on its position in the layout template.

> The default behaviour of the layout dialect has historically been to place the
> `<title>` element at the beginning of the `<head>` element during the
> decoration process; an arbitrary design decision which made development of
> this library easier.  However, this runs against the expectations of
> developers who wished to control the order of elements, most notably the
> practice of putting `<meta charset...>` as the first element in the `<head>`.
> The new strategies (ones with `RespectLayoutTitle` in their name) instead keep
> `<title>`s wherever they exist within the target/layout template being
> decorated, and then work on everything else as normal.
> 
> The `RespectLayoutTitle` strategies were introduced in version 2.4.0 and will
> become the default strategies from version 3.x.  The existing strategies are
> now deprecated but retain the historic behaviour, maintaining backwards
> compatibility with the 2.x versions.

To change to the grouping strategy, configure the Layout dialect using one of
the methods below.

For those who are configuring their own Thymeleaf template engine:

```java
TemplateEngine templateEngine = new TemplateEngine();  // Or SpringTemplateEngine for Spring
templateEngine.addDialect(new LayoutDialect(new GroupingRespectLayoutTitleStrategy()));
```

For those using XML config in Spring:

```xml
<bean id="groupingStrategy" class="nz.net.ultraq.thymeleaf.decorators.strategies.GroupingRespectLayoutTitleStrategy"/>

<bean id="templateEngine" class="org.thymeleaf.spring4.SpringTemplateEngine">
  <property name="additionalDialects">
    <set>
      <bean class="nz.net.ultraq.thymeleaf.LayoutDialect">
        <constructor-arg ref="groupingStrategy"/>
      </bean>
    </set>
  </property>
</bean>
```

For those using Spring Boot and Java configuration:

```java
@Bean
public LayoutDialect layoutDialect() {
	return new LayoutDialect(new GroupingRespectLayoutTitleStrategy());
}
```

If neither strategy suits your needs, you can implement your own `SortingStrategy`
and pass it along to the layout dialect like above.


Bypassing `<head>` element merging altogether
---------------------------------------------

From version 2.4.0, an experimental option was added to skip the special `<head>`
merging entirely.  Reasons for this might be that you wish to manage that
section yourself so are using things like Thymeleaf's `th:replace` to fill that
special part of your HTML document in.

To bypass the layout dialect's `<head>` element merging, a second parameter to
the `LayoutDialect` constructor should be set to `false`.  (The first parameter
can be set to `null` as a merging strategy isn't really relevant when `<head>`
element merging is disabled.)

For those who are configuring their own Thymeleaf template engine:

```java
TemplateEngine templateEngine = new TemplateEngine();  // Or SpringTemplateEngine for Spring
templateEngine.addDialect(new LayoutDialect(null, false));
```

For those using Spring Boot and Java configuration:

```java
@Bean
public LayoutDialect layoutDialect() {
	return new LayoutDialect(null, false);
}
```

When disabled, the `<head>` element will be whatever it was in the content
template, so the `<head>` from the layout is not applied.
