A dialect for Thymeleaf that allows you to use layout/decorator templates to
style your content, as well as pass entire fragment elements to included pages,
all to help improve code reuse.  If you've ever used SiteMesh for your JSPs, or
Facelets with JSFs, then the concepts of this library will be very familiar to
you.


Installation
------------

Minimum of Java 6 and Thymeleaf 3.0 required.

### Standalone distribution
Copy the JAR from [one of the release bundles](https://github.com/zhanhb/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/releases),
placing it in the classpath of your application, or build the project from the
source code here on GitHub.

### For Maven and Maven-compatible dependency managers
Add a dependency to your project with the following co-ordinates:

 - GroupId: `com.github.zhanhb`
 - ArtifactId: `thymeleaf-layout-dialect`
 - Version: (as per the badges above)


Usage
-----

Add the Layout dialect to your existing Thymeleaf template engine, eg:

```java
TemplateEngine templateEngine = new TemplateEngine();
templateEngine.addDialect(new LayoutDialect());
```

Or, for those using Spring configuration files:

```xml
<bean id="templateEngine" class="org.thymeleaf.spring4.SpringTemplateEngine">
  <property name="additionalDialects">
    <set>
      <bean class="nz.net.ultraq.thymeleaf.LayoutDialect"/>
    </set>
  </property>
</bean>
```

This will introduce the `layout` namespace, and 5 new attribute processors that
you can use in your templates: `decorator`, `include`, `replace`, `fragment`,
and `title-pattern`.

### decorator

 - XML attribute: `layout:decorator`
 - Data attribute: `data-layout-decorator`

Used in your content templates and declared in the root tag (usually `<html>`),
this processor specifies the location of the decorator template to apply.  The
mechanism for resolving decorator pages is the same as that used by Thymeleaf to
resolve `th:fragment` and `th:replace` templates.

Check out the [Decorators and fragments](#decorators-and-fragments) example for
how to apply a decorator to your content templates.

### include

 - XML attribute: `layout:include`
 - Data attribute: `data-layout-include`

Similar to Thymeleaf's `th:include`, but allows the passing of entire element
fragments to the included template.  Useful if you have some HTML that you want
to reuse, but whose contents are too complex to determine or construct with
context variables alone.

Check out the [Includes and fragments](#includes-and-fragments) example for how
to pass HTML code to the templates you want to include.

### replace

 - XML attribute: `layout:replace`
 - Data attribute: `data-layout-replace`

Similar to `layout:include` in that you can pass HTML content to the
template/fragments you're replacing, but with the behaviour of Thymeleaf's `th:replace`.

### fragment

 - XML attribute: `layout:fragment`
 - Data attribute: `data-layout-fragment`

The glue that holds everything together; it marks sections in the decorator
template that can be replaced by sections in the content template, which share
the same name.

### title-pattern

 - XML attribute: `layout:title-pattern`
 - Data attribute: `data-layout-title-pattern`

Allows for greater control of the resulting `<title>` element by specifying a
pattern with some special tokens.  This can be used to extend the decorator's
title with the content's one, instead of simply overriding it.

Check out the [Configuring your Title](#configuring-your-title) example for how
to control the final title of your page.


Examples
--------

> The following examples:
>  - use the XML attribute version of the processors, but can just as easily be
>    swapped for their HTML data attribute equivalents if that's more your style
>  - assume that the Thymeleaf template engine is configured with `.html` as a
>    suffix.  This is the default in a lot of framework configurations, such as
>    Spring Boot.

### Decorators and fragments

Create a template that will contain a layout that will be shared across
templates.  Often this will be a template that contains a page header,
navigation, a footer, and a spot where your content will go.

```html
Layout.html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html xmlns:layout="http://www.ultraq.net.nz/thymeleaf/layout">
  <head>
    <title>Layout page</title>
    <script src="common-script.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
      <h1>My website</h1>
    </header>
    <section layout:fragment="content">
      <p>Page content goes here</p>
    </section>
    <footer>
      <p>My footer</p>
      <p layout:fragment="custom-footer">Custom footer here</p>
    </footer>  
  </body>
</html>
```

Notice how the `layout:fragment` attribute was applied to the `<section>` and
`<p>` element in the footer.  These are the points in the decorator that are
candidates for replacement by matching fragments in your content templates.

Now, create some content templates.

```html
Content1.html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html xmlns:layout="http://www.ultraq.net.nz/thymeleaf/layout"
  layout:decorator="Layout">
  <head>
    <title>Content page 1</title>
    <script src="content-script.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <section layout:fragment="content">
      <p>This is a paragraph from content page 1</p>
    </section>
    <footer>
      <p layout:fragment="custom-footer">This is some footer content from content page 1</p>
    </footer>
  </body>
</html>
```

The `layout:decorator` in the `<html>` tag says which decorator template to
apply to this content template.  The content template defines its own title and
script, as well as both the `content` and `custom-footer` fragments.  The `custom-footer`
fragment is within a `<footer>` element, which isn't really necessary, but might
be handy if you wish to do static templating of the content template which is
one of the reasons one uses Thymeleaf in the first place :)

> Fragment names must be unique within a template, otherwise fragment mismatches
> can occur and all sorts of hilarity will ensue.

Anyway, once you tell Thymeleaf to process `Content1.html`, the resulting page
will look like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Content page 1</title>
    <script src="common-script.js"></script>
    <script src="content-script.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
      <h1>My website</h1>
    </header>
    <section>
      <p>This is a paragraph from content page 1</p>
    </section>
    <footer>
      <p>My footer</p>
      <p>This is some footer content from content page 1</p>
    </footer>  
  </body>
</html>
```

The content template was 'decorated' by the elements of `Layout.html`, the
result being a combination of the decorator, plus the fragments of the content
template (`<head>` elements from both templates, with the `<title>` element from
the content template taking place of the decorator's, all elements from the
decorator, but replaced by all content template fragments where specified).

For more on how you can control the merging of `<head>` elements, see the
[<head> element merging](#head-element-merging) section.

> The decoration process redirects processing from your content template to the
> decorator, picking `layout:fragment` parts out of your content template as the
> decorator template demands them.  Because of this, anything _outside_ of a
> `layout:fragment` within the `<body>` in your content template never actually
> gets executed, meaning you can't do this in your content template:
> 
> ```html
> <div th:if="${user.admin}">
>   <div layout:fragment="content">
>     ...
>   </div>
> </div>
> ```
> 
> If the decorator wants the 'content' fragment, then it'll get that fragment,
> regardless of any conditions around it because those conditions aren't
> executed.

Say you just want to replace _only_ the footer of your decorator with the
absolute minimum of HTML code:

```html
Content2.html

<p layout:decorator="Layout" layout:fragment="custom-footer">
  This is some footer text from content page 2.
</p>
```

And that's all you need!  The `<p>` tag acts as both root element and fragment
definition, resulting in a page that will look like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Layout page</title>
    <script src="common-script.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
      <h1>My website</h1>
    </header>
    <section>
      <p>Page content goes here</p>
    </section>
    <footer>
      <p>My footer</p>
      <p>
        This is some footer text from content page 2.
      </p>
    </footer>  
  </body>
</html>
```

You can think of the decorator as your parent template that will get filled-up
or overwritten by your content (child templates), but only if your content
chooses to fill-up/overwrite the parent.  This way the decorator acts as a sort
of 'default', with your content acting as implementations on top of this default.


### Includes and fragments

Say you have some HTML or structure that you find repeating over and over and
want to make into its own template that you include from several places to
reduce code duplication.  (Modular Thymeleaf anybody?)  An example of this might
be a modal panel consisting of several HTML elements and CSS classes to create
the illusion of a new window within your web application:

```html
Modal.html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <div id="modal-container" class="modal-container" style="display:none;">
      <section id="modal" class="modal">
        <header>
          <h1>My Modal</h1>
          <div id="close-modal" class="modal-close">
            <a href="#close">Close</a>
          </div>
        </header>
        <div id="modal-content" class="modal-content">
          <p>My modal content</p>
        </div>
      </section>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

You find you can turn some things into variables like the header and IDs so that
pages including `Modal.html` can set their own name/IDs.  You continue making
your modal code as generic as possible, but then you get to the question of
filling-in the content of your modal panel, and that's where you start to reach
some limitations.

Some of the pages use a modal that includes a simple message, others want to use
the modal to hold something more complex like a form to accept user input. The
possibilities for your modal become endless, but to support your imagination you
find yourself having to copy this modal structure into each page and vary the
contents for each use case, repeating the same HTML code to maintain the same
look-and-feel, breaking the [DRY principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)
in the process.

The main thing holding you back from proper reuse is the inability to pass HTML
elements to your included page.  That's where `layout:include` comes in.  It
works exactly like `th:include`, but by specifying and implementing fragments
much like with content/decorator examples, you can create a common structure
that can respond to the use case of the page including it.

Here's an updated modal template, made more generic using Thymeleaf and the
`layout:fragment` attribute to define a replaceable modal content section:

```html
Modal2.html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org"
  xmlns:layout="http://www.ultraq.net.nz/thymeleaf/layout">
  <body layout:fragment="modal(modalId, modalHeader)">
    <div th:id="${modalId} + '-container'" class="modal-container" style="display:none;">
      <section th:id="${modalId}" class="modal">
        <header>
          <h1 th:text="${modalHeader}">My Modal</h1>
          <div th:id="'close-' + ${modalId}" class="modal-close">
            <a href="#close">Close</a>
          </div>
        </header>
        <div th:id="${modalId} + '-content'" class="modal-content">
          <div layout:fragment="modal-content">
            <p>My modal content</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </section>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

Now you can include the template using the `layout:include` attribute and
implement the `modal-content` fragment however you need by creating a fragment
of the same name _within the include element_ of the calling template:

```html
Content.html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org"
  xmlns:layout="http://www.ultraq.net.nz/thymeleaf/layout">

  ...

  <div layout:include="Modal2 :: modal(modalId='message', modalHeader='Message')" th:remove="tag">
    <p layout:fragment="modal-content">Message goes here!</p>
  </div>

  ...

</html>
```

Just like with the content/decorator example, the `layout:fragment` of the
template you're including will be replaced by the element with the matching
fragment name.  In this case, the entire `modal-content` of `Modal2.html` will
be replaced by the custom paragraph above.  Here's the result:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

  ...

  <div id="message-container" class="modal-container" style="display:none;">
    <section id="message" class="modal">
      <header>
        <h1>Message</h1>
        <div id="close-message" class="modal-close">
          <a href="#close">Close</a>
        </div>
      </header>
      <div id="message-content" class="modal-content">
        <p>Message goes here!</p>
      </div>
    </section>
  </div>

  ...

</html>
```

The custom message defined in the template including `Modal2.html` was made a
part of the contents of the modal.  Fragments in the context of an included
template work the same as they do when used in the context of a decorator: if
the fragment isn't defined in your template, then it won't override whatever is
in the included page, allowing you to create defaults in your included template.


### Configuring your title

Given that the Layout dialect automatically overrides the decorator's `title`
element with that found in the content template, you might find yourself
repeating parts of the title found in the decorator, especially if you like to
create breadcrumbs or retain the name of the website in the page title.  The `layout:title-pattern`
attribute can save you the trouble of repeating the decorator title by using
some special tokens in a pattern of how you want your title to appear.

Here's an example:

```html
Layout.html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html xmlns:layout="http://www.ultraq.net.nz/thymeleaf/layout">
  <head>
    <title layout:title-pattern="$DECORATOR_TITLE - $CONTENT_TITLE">My website</title>
  </head>

  ...

</html>
```

The `layout:title-pattern` attribute is a simple string that recognizes 2
special tokens: `$DECORATOR_TITLE` and `$CONTENT_TITLE`.  Each token will be
replaced by their respective titles in the resulting page.  So, if you had the
following content template:

```html
Content.html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html xmlns:layout="http://www.ultraq.net.nz/thymeleaf/layout"
  layout:decorator="Layout">

  <head>
    <title>My blog</title>
  </head>

  ...

</html>
```

The resulting page would be:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

  <head>
    <title>My website - My blog</title>
  </head>

  ...

</html>
```

This works for both static text inside the `<title>` elements, and dynamic text
either inlined using `th:inline="text"` or resolved using `th:text`.

The pattern was specified in the decorator, so applies to all content templates
that make use of the decorator.  If you specify another title pattern in the
content template, then it will override the one found in the decorator, allowing
for fine-grained control of the appearance of your title.

> As of 1.3.0, the resulting title is accessible via `layout.resultingTitle`.
> `layout` is a special object added by this dialect (just like how Thymeleaf
> adds `session`, `param`, and `application` objects), to expose some internals.
> Right now, `resultingTitle` is the only value on this object.


Configuration
-------------

### `<head>` element merging

By default, when decorating the `<head>` sections of the content and decorator
templates, the result is that the content elements will come after the decorator
ones.  Some use cases need a smarter merging of elements, such as grouping like
elements together (having scripts with scripts and stylesheets with stylesheets).
The Layout dialect supports both of these use cases, with the ability for
developers to define their own sorting.

This sorting is exposed by the `nz.net.ultraq.thymeleaf.decorators.SortingStrategy`
interface and the layout dialect provides 2 implementations to choose from:

 - `AppendingStrategy`, the default, appends content `<head>` elements after
   decorator ones
 - `GroupingStrategy`, groups like elements together

To change to the grouping strategy, configure the Layout dialect like so:

```java
TemplateEngine templateEngine = new TemplateEngine();
templateEngine.addDialect(new LayoutDialect(new GroupingStrategy()));
```

Spring XML:

```xml
<bean id="groupingStrategy" class="nz.net.ultraq.thymeleaf.decorators.strategies.GroupingStrategy"/>

<bean id="templateEngine" class="org.thymeleaf.spring4.SpringTemplateEngine">
  <property name="additionalDialects">
    <set>
      <bean class="nz.net.ultraq.thymeleaf.LayoutDialect">
        <constructor-arg ref="groupingStrategy"/>
      </bean>
    </set>
  </property>
</bean>
```

If neither strategy suits your needs, you can implement your own `SortingStrategy`
and pass it along to the Layout dialect like above.
