=========

### 2.0.1
 - Fix `NullPointerException` when using any of the `include`/`insert`/`replace`
   processors with a full template fragment expression
   ([#120](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/120))

### 2.0.0
 - Layout dialect rewritten to support Thymeleaf 3
   ([#68](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/68),
   [Layout Dialect 2.0 milestone](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/milestone/6?closed=1))
 - `layout:decorator` processor renamed to `layout:decorate`, `$DECORATOR_TITLE`
   renamed to `$LAYOUT_TITLE`
   ([#95](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/95))
 - Deprecated `layout:include` processor for the new `layout:insert` processor
   ([#107](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/107))
 - New documentation site created to hold what was turning into a gigantic
   readme!
   ([#115](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/115))

Upgrading to 2.0?  I've written a migration guide to help make the transition
easier.  Check it out on the new documentation pages site, here:
https://ultraq.github.io/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/MigrationGuide.html

As of release there are still some tests that have been disabled and may
cause regressions for these use cases.  They are listed here:
https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/blob/d4f57d08cbf5c70a33cfa45283015811c90a3765/Tests/nz/net/ultraq/thymeleaf/tests/LayoutDialectTestExecutor.groovy#L55-L61
One is a very specific and rare case, another is an undocumented use of the
layout dialect, and the commented one I don't feel I should fix as it feels like
the incorrect use of an element.  For those first 2 cases, I'll work on them in
upcoming patches so they don't hold up the release.

### 1.4.0
 - Change the behaviour of merging `th:with` attributes so that child pages can
   override layout values
   ([#99](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/99))
 - Fixed lack of a 'groovydoc' archive being included with the download bundle
   and Maven artifacts

### 1.3.3
 - Don't copy collapsible whitespace between `<head>` elements during decoration
   ([#92](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/92))

### 1.3.2
 - Prevent `IllegalArgumentException` when using a template with a condensed
   `<head>` section
   ([#90](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/90))
 - Fix fragment scoping so that fragments from one decorator/include/replace
   operation aren't shared with other ones
   ([#87](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/87))

### 1.3.1
 - Restore Java 6 support
   ([#85](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/85))

### 1.3.0
 - Dialect rewritten in Groovy
 - Dropped the deprecated `substituteby` processor
 - Allow the title to be completely processed
   ([#72](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/72)) before
   expanding the value of `title-pattern`, fixing cases like that described in
   ([#64](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/64))
 - Split out the `<head>` element sorting into a customizable sorting strategy,
   and provided strategies for each of the behaviours that the layout dialect
   has implemented in the past.  See the
   [<head> element merging](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect#head-element-merging)
   section in the README for more details.

### 1.2.9
 - Have all non-element nodes (text, comments) included in the merging of the
   `<head>` section
   ([#70](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/70))

### 1.2.8
 - Contribution from [Oliver Niekrenz](https://github.com/oniekrenz) to fix a
   recursion issue in the way fragments are picked out of templates
   ([#60](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/pull/60))

### 1.2.7
 - Fix for `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`s coming out of the grouping feature
   introduced in 1.2.6
   ([#54](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/54))

### 1.2.6
 - Reduce the amount of whitespace copied surrounding the `<html>` tag
   ([#50](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/50))
 - Start logic to group like elements in the merged `<head>` section together
   ([#52](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/52))

### 1.2.5
 - Restore title fallback behaviour when either content or decorator title
   elements are empty
   ([#45](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/45))
 - Fix title creation when using `th:text` without a `layout:title-pattern`
   processor
   ([#46](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/pull/46))

### 1.2.4
 - Contribution from [Justin Munn](https://github.com/munnja001) to fix bugs in
   the `layout:title-pattern` processor, making it behave more naturally in the
   process
   ([#42](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/pull/42))

### 1.2.3
 - Fix for nested layout fragments using the replace/substituteby processors
   ([#37](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/37))
 - Don't pass arbitrary attributes (ie: anything that isn't an attribute
   processor) up to decorator pages if the content template is a fragment
   ([#39](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/39))

### 1.2.2
 - Allow passing variables for all document types, not just full HTML templates
   ([#32](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/32))
 - Remove the reliance on Thymeleaf's [literal substitutions](http://www.thymeleaf.org/whatsnew21.html#lsub)
   feature for the `layout:title-pattern` processor, allowing devs to use the
   pipe `|` character in their title patterns
   ([#33]((https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/33)))
 - Fix the passing of decorator/content title values up deep layout hierarchies
   ([#34](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/34))

### 1.2.1
 - Restore `layout:decorator` behaviour when using it for deep page hierarchies
   in Thymeleaf 2.1.2
   ([#30](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/30))

### 1.2
 - Works with Thymeleaf 2.1
   ([#26](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/26))
 - `layout:title-pattern` now works on title text created using the `th:text`
   attribute
   ([#28](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/28))

### 1.1.4
 - Minor bugfixes, small refactoring, and a large cleanup as a result of the
   work done towards being compatible with Thymeleaf 2.1.

### 1.1.3
 - Refactored handling of `<title>` elements for when they're lacking in either
   content or decorator templates and the `layout:title-pattern` processor is
   being used
   ([#25](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/25))
 - Added a `layout:replace` attribute processor, an alias of `layout:substituteby`
   (Just like Thymeleaf, the `replace` processor will eventually replace `substituteby`.
   They both perform the same function, but `substituteby` is effectively
   deprecated.)
 - Updated the Eclipse plugin help file to point to the updated 1.1.x processor
   locations.

### 1.1.2
 - Relaxed the root element restriction when using the `LEGACYHTML5` template
   mode due to the way the NekoHTML parser works on HTML fragments
   ([#23](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/23))

### 1.1.1
 - Restore the help/documentation file so that this dialect will appear in
   content assist in the Thymeleaf Eclipse plugin. (I used a new build process
   for the 1.1 branch, and it missed this resource file!  Apologies for that
   folks.)

### 1.1
 - Change package to `nz.net.ultraq.thymeleaf` (dropped the 'web' part).
 - Change XML namespace to `http://www.ultraq.net.nz/thymeleaf/layout` (dropped
   the 'web' part).
 - Implemented unit tests, using the [Thymeleaf Testing](https://github.com/thymeleaf/thymeleaf-testing)
   library.
 - Added a `layout:substituteby` processor which works much like `layout:include`,
   but with the behaviour of Thymeleaf's `th:substituteby`
   ([#21](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/21))

### 1.0.6
 - Added a help/documentation file so that this dialect will appear in content
   assist in the Thymeleaf Eclipse plugin.

### 1.0.5
 - Added the ability to specify the final `<title>` through a configurable
   pattern, specified in a new `layout:title-pattern` attribute.
 - Made code emit a warning to the logs if the `layout:fragment` element was in
   the `<title>` element (I keep seeing people doing this, even though it's not
   required since the dialect automatically takes the content `<title>` over the
   decorator `<title>`).
 - Made it so that content outside the decorator page's `<html>` element (like
   IE conditional comments) are included in the resulting page
   ([#10](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/10))

### 1.0.4
 - Fixed enforcing of `layout:decorator` element being in the root element,
   leading to a better error message if this attribute is found elsewhere.
 - Fixed the resulting JAR which didn't recreate the proper Maven metadata in
   the manifest section and might have caused it to not be picked up by tools
   like m2eclipse.
 - Fix a `ClassCastException` for cases when `layout:include` was used to
   include entire pages
   ([#7](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/7))

### 1.0.3
 - Added a `layout:include` attribute which works like `th:include` but allows
   for the passing of element fragments to the included page.
 - Allow `th:with` local variable declarations made in the decorator page to be
   visible in content pages during processing
   ([#3](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/3))
 - Removed the restriction that the `layout:decorator` tag appear in an HTML
   element since Thymeleaf 2.0.10 relaxed that restriction too (tag must still
   appear in the root element of your page however)
   ([#4](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/4))
 - Updated Thymeleaf dependency to 2.0.11 for a required API change.

### 1.0.2
 - Allow a decorator and content pages to contain just a `<head>` section, or
   just a `<body>` section, or neither section, or some other combination
   between pages
   ([#2](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/2))

### 1.0.1
 - Switched from Ant to Gradle as a build tool and to generate Maven-compatible
   artifacts.
 - To appease the Mavenites amongst you, the project is now being served from
   Maven Central, co-ordinates added to [installation](#installation)
   instructions
   ([#1](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/1))

### 1.0
 - Initial release.
